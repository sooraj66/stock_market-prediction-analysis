# stock_market-prediction-analysis
# Overview
This project focuses on utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to analyze historical stock market data, derive insights, and predict future trends in stock prices. The analysis aims to gain insights into price movements, trends, and patterns using various data visualization techniques. The ultimate goal is to explore how algorithms predict future outcomes and evaluate their predictive capabilities.

# Purpose
. The purpose of this project is to understand how well LSTM neural networks work for time series forecasting by utilizing historical data to identify trends and patterns.
. Develop predictive model for forcasting future stock closing price.
. Analyzing the abilty of the predictive models to replicate the actual market trends.
. Gain insights into challenges and limitations of algorithmic stock market prediction.

# Technologies used
. Python
. TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM implementation)
. Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
. Matplotlib, Seaborn , Plotly (for data visualization)
. Jupyter Notebook (for analysis and presentation)

# Future enhancements
. Hypertuning LSTM for improved prediction.
. Development of interactive dashboards for real-time market analysis.
